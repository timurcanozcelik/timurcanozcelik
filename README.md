- Hi, I’m @timurcanozcelik, a psychology and developmental neuroscience research assistant and an aspiring PhD student! 

- I’m interested in doing research that helps us understand how subjective experience comes about, how the sense that I am me emerges, and what this tells us about why some people lead fulfilling lives while others struggle to. 

- I’m currently learning how to make computers do computer and statistics things, with the hope that they will help me conduct interesting research and make pretty graphs. I've also recently started practicing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu and am learning to play the guitar.

- Fun fact: There's this fungus called Ophiocordyceps unilateralis. It's commonly known as zombie-ant fungus because it infects ants and takes over their behaviour. The fungus takes the ant away from their nests and foraging trails, towards areas that are suitable for fungal growth. When the ant arrives at a fungi friendly area, they climb beneath a leaf, bite into it, and the fungus begins growing out the ants head and body, killing the ant. If I could interview these ants, I'd want to know what it's like being a zombie, and was life more fulfilling before or after zombification?
